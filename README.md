I want to become a software engineer. I was enrolled at a university where I studied software development but didn't feel like I was learning enough. 
That is why I'm now embarking on a self education journey. In about six months, starting from June, I plan on being able to apply for a junior software engineering job.

### Tentative plan:

- [ ] (Java) Build a cinema booking system to evaluate my java skills
- [ ] Discrete Math
- [ ] Algorithms and Data Structures
- [ ] (Java) Build a map of Denmark with navigation, searching, and route planning
- [ ] Object-Oriented analysis and design
- [ ] Database
- [ ] Operating Systems and C
