Once upon a time, there was a man who thought that almost every subject was uber exciting and thus could not make up his mind. I'm currently working on my skills as a software developer... Skills I have very little of as of the moment of writing.
I was enrolled at a university and have completed some courses but didn't feel like I learned anything. This is why I'm now
DIY'ing my own software development education.

It will begin on April first and run for 6 months. The plan will be a hybrid between courses from my former university and "The Open Source Computer Science Degree" from ForrestKnight(https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs). 
The first version of the plan will be posted here on April first and updated as I complete items or change items in it.
