I want to become a software engineer. I was enrolled at a university where I studied software development but didn't feel like I was learning enough. 
That is why I'm now embarking on a self education journey.


It will begin on April first and run for 6 months. The plan will be a hybrid between courses from my former university and "The Open Source Computer Science Degree" from ForrestKnight (https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs). 
The first version of the plan will be posted here on April first and updated as I complete items or change items in it.
